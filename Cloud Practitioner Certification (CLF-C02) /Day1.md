Road Map 
The patch im thinking of taking is cloud practioner -> sysops administrator -> Devops engineer -> Security

Cloud computing 
 
The practice of using network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer

(Godaddy, HostGator etc)
So what is shared hosting?
Think of it like sharing an apartment with roommates:
•	🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Multiple websites live on the same server (just like roommates in one apartment).
•	🧠 You share resources like CPU, RAM, storage, and bandwidth.
•	💸 It's cheap—great for beginners or small websites.
•	🛠️ The hosting company (like HostGator) manages the server setup and maintenance for you.

 
 

 


Whats AWS??
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
 









What is Cloud Service Provider (CSP)
🌐 What is a CSP (Cloud Service Provider)?
A Cloud Service Provider is a company that offers cloud computing services — like storage, computing power, databases, networking, and more — over the internet.
Basically, they let you rent IT infrastructure instead of buying and maintaining your own servers.

 
IaaS – that means they have networking compute storage database etc..

Landscape of CSPs
Tier-1 (Top Tier)
 
Tier-2 
 
Tier-3
 
Tier- 4  Private tier= its basically a software you can deploy onto your own machine, datacenter to get the same functionality that you would as if you were using aws gcp
 

 
The term Cloud Computing can be used to refer to all categories, even though it has “compute” in the name.
Common Cloud Services
Compute – 	
Compute
What it means:
Running your applications on virtual machines or containers instead of your own physical servers.
Examples:
•	AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
•	Azure Virtual Machines
•	Google Compute Engine
Use case:
•	Hosting a website
•	Running backend code
•	Handling traffic spikes during product launches

Storage – 
Storage
What it means:
Saving files, backups, or any kind of data in the cloud — safely, reliably, and at scale.
Types of cloud storage:
•	Object Storage: Ideal for unstructured data like images, videos (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob)
•	Block Storage: Like a hard drive attached to a VM (e.g., AWS EBS)
•	File Storage: Shared network drives (e.g., Amazon EFS)
Use case:
•	Storing user-uploaded photos or videos
•	Backing up databases
•	Keeping documents and reports

Networking – 
Networking
What it means:
Connecting your cloud services, managing traffic between apps, users, and databases, and securing data transmission.
Examples:
•	Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) – isolated network within the cloud
•	Load Balancers – distribute traffic across multiple servers
•	CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) – deliver content faster globally (e.g., AWS CloudFront)
Use case:
•	Making your app accessible from anywhere
•	Improving speed and security
•	Connecting services securely (e.g., backend to database)

Databases - 
What it means:
Fully managed database services without having to set up or maintain servers.
Types of databases:
•	Relational: SQL-based (e.g., AWS RDS, Azure SQL, Google Cloud SQL)
•	NoSQL: Document, key-value, or graph-based (e.g., DynamoDB, Cosmos DB, Firebase)
Use case:
•	Storing user accounts, app data, logs
•	Running analytics
•	Building real-time applications (like chat or gaming)
 


 

 
One single physical server for single customer – its secure, but its up to you to make it secure.

 
Virtual machine – very popular and most common offering for compute because people are comfortable.

 
Containers
 
Serverless compute- you don’t even think about the OS.  You jtus know your runetime  you just run ruby python or node and you just upload the code and you just say I want this to be able to run for this run and use this much of memory. Only pay for the time its running. COLD STARTS
"You don’t even think about the OS. You just know your runtime."
✔️ YES — with serverless, you don't manage servers, VMs, or OS at all. You just focus on your code and runtime (Node.js, Python, Ruby, etc.).
"You just upload the code and say: run it like this, with this memory."
✔️ Exactly — you define how much memory, how long it can run, and the platform handles the scaling, execution, and infrastructure.
"You only pay for the time it’s running."
✔️ YES! Unlike traditional hosting where you pay 24/7 for a server, serverless is event-based and billed per execution time (e.g., milliseconds).
"COLD STARTS"
✔️ Nailed it — a cold start happens when the serverless platform needs to spin up a new container to run your function. It causes slight delay (usually milliseconds) on the first call after idle time.

 

Types of Cloud Computing
SaaS – Software as Service. Don’t worry about how the service is maintained. It juts works and remains available. Designed for CUSTOMERS

PaaS – platform as a service – Focus on the deployment and management of your apps. Don’t worry about providing configuring or understanding the hardware or OS.
Elastic Bean stack, HEROKU (Very popular among developer, that just want to deploy their code), Google App Engine. Designed for Developer. You juts deploy and the code. And server does the rest.

IaaS – Infracturure as a Service – the basic building blocks for cloud IT. Provides access to networking features, computers, and data storage space. Don’t worry about IT staff, data centers, and hardware. – for aministrator

Public Cloud – built on  CSP  
 
Everything built on a company data center and being data center resides where you work
